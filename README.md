# AzureWebAppDemo
ASP.NET Core web application. Uses MS Azure services.

In the app you can fill out forms and send them to Azure's storage. On another page you can view sent forms in text form and delete them from storage.

At the time of writing, the service is actively hosted at:

This app was made in a couple days for the purpose of demoing my abilities for IT company Solteq. MS Azure and .NET Core were not familiar to me before starting. It is a little bit rough around the edges and there may be some logical flaws I haven't noticed, but I think it is a fair representation of what I can manage in a couple days, with the help of existing frameworks.
